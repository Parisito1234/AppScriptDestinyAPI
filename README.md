# AppScriptDestinyAPI
Bungie.net API Library Information

Hey everyone, I've made a Google App Script Library for the Bungie.net API
Currently the library only supports Destiny 2 no-auth endpoints, but has an included function that can be called to simplify and tidy up API requests.

Next update will add GroupsV2 support, with Content support planned for later.
I currently am not planning on adding things that require OAuth, so please handle that within your own applications
